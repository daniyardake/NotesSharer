VALUES('A connected graph is graph that is connected in the sense of a topological space, i.e., there is a path from any point to any other point in the graph.

VALUES('Lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets are all iterable objects. They are iterable containers which you can get an iterator from. All these objects have a iter() method which is used to get an iterator. To create an object/class as an iterator you have to implement the methods __iter__() and __next__() to your object. As you have learned in the Python Classes/Objects chapter, all classes have a function called __init__(), which allows you to do some initializing when the object is being created. The __iter__() method acts similar, you can do operations (initializing etc.), but must always return the iterator object itself. The __next__() method also allows you to do operations, and must return the next item in the sequence.', 9, 'MIT', 'Intro to Python', 'Iterators');

VALUES('A proof by induction consists of two cases. The first, the base case (or basis), proves the statement for n = 0 without assuming any knowledge of other cases. The second case, the induction step, proves that if the statement holds for any given case n = k, then it must also hold for the next case n = k + 1. These two steps establish that the statement holds for every natural number n.[3] The base case does not necessarily begin with n = 0, but often with n = 1, and possibly with any fixed natural number n = N, establishing the truth of the statement for all natural numbers n â‰¥ N. The method can be extended to prove statements about more general well-founded structures, such as trees; this generalization, known as structural induction, is used in mathematical logic and computer science. Mathematical induction in this extended sense is closely related to recursion. Mathematical induction is an inference rule used in formal proofs, and in some form is the foundation of all correctness proofs for computer programs.[4] Although its name may suggest otherwise, mathematical induction should not be confused with inductive reasoning as used in philosophy (see Problem of induction). The mathematical method examines infinitely many cases to prove a general statement, but does so by a finite chain of deductive reasoning involving the variable n, which can take infinitely many values.[5] ', 8, 'Harvard College', 'Discrete Math 2', 'Mathematical Induction');

VALUES('To create a file in Java, you can use the createNewFile() method. This method returns a boolean value: true if the file was successfully created, and false if the file already exists. Note that the method is enclosed in a try...catch block. This is necessary because it throws an IOException if an error occurs (if the file cannot be created for some reason). To create a file in a specific directory (requires permission), specify the path of the file and use double backslashes to escape the "\" character (for Windows). On Mac and Linux you can just write the path, like: /Users/name/filename.txt', 2, 'Tufts University', 'Java Programming', 'Input/Output Files');

VALUES('Given a sorted array arr[] of n elements, write a function to search a given element x in arr[]. A simple approach is to do linear search.The time complexity of above algorithm is O(n). Another approach to perform the same task is using Binary Search. Binary Search: Search a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. Begin with an interval covering the whole array. If the value of the search key is less than the item in the middle of the interval, narrow the interval to the lower half. Otherwise narrow it to the upper half. Repeatedly check until the value is found or the interval is empty.', 10, 'Suffolk University', 'Data Structures and Algorithms', 'Binary Search');

VALUES('Linear and Logistic regressions are usually the first algorithms people learn in data science. Due to their popularity, a lot of analysts even end up thinking that they are the only form of regressions. The ones who are slightly more involved think that they are the most important among all forms of regression analysis. The truth is that there are innumerable forms of regressions, which can be performed. Each form has its own importance and a specific condition where they are best suited to apply. In this article, I have explained the most commonly used 7 types of regression in data science in a simple manner. Through this article, I also hope that people develop an idea of the breadth of regressions, instead of just applying linear/logistic regression to every machine learning problem they come across and hoping that they would just fit!', 7, 'MIT', 'Intro to Machine Learning', 'Regression Models');

VALUES('NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays. It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices. NumPy was created in 2005 by Travis Oliphant. It is an open source project and you can use it freely. NumPy stands for Numerical Python. In Python we have lists that serve the purpose of arrays, but they are slow to process. NumPy aims to provide an array object that is up to 50x faster than traditional Python lists. The array object in NumPy is called ndarray, it provides a lot of supporting functions that make working with ndarray very easy. Arrays are very frequently used in data science, where speed and resources are very important. NumPy arrays are stored at one continuous place in memory unlike lists, so processes can access and manipulate them very efficiently. This behavior is called locality of reference in computer science. This is the main reason why NumPy is faster than lists. Also it is optimized to work with latest CPU architectures.', 4, 'Suffolk University', 'Intro to Data Science', 'NumPy');
